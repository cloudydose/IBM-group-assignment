### Input technologies 

Input technologies are crucial components that allow for the entry of data or commands into electronic devices or computers. In the context of the airline industry, two important input technologies are self-service check-in kiosks and handheld devices.

Kiosk check-in is a self-service technology available at select airports that enables passengers to quickly and easily check themselves in using a touch-screen kiosk. Its functionalities include self-service flight check-in, printing of boarding passes, and printing of baggage tags for convenient baggage inspection. One of the main advantages of this technology is a faster check-in process, which helps reduce queue times for passengers. Furthermore, the utilization of kiosk check-in technology in the airline industry can lead to a reduction in operational costs as it enables the organization to operate with fewer on-site staff. Kiosks are capable of performing various automated tasks, freeing up employees' time to handle more complex challenges such as customer service.

Second, handheld devices are designed to be portable and easy to use. It can also keep airline passengers constantly connected and informed. In the airline industry, the ground crew is responsible for the maintenance and supply of aircraft. To facilitate their task management, a handheld device is provided. The device allows ramp managers to assign tasks to ramp crews by sending an alert to their watch. The crew can confirm the assignment with one touch and mark the task as complete with another touch. In addition, two-way communication is available between ramp crews and baggage handlers, which does not require the use of hands.

### Output technologies

The results or information generated by a system, method, or program are referred to as output. Output in computer programming can apply to any type of data that a program creates and writes to a file, another device, or the user's screen, including audio, text, images, and others. For summary, output is the finished product of a procedure or software that can be seen, examined, or otherwise used. 

After that, the output device, an output device is a hardware device used to display the result from a system or computer after being produced, in other words, output device is a device to display output data. Back to the major, the most important output device in the airline company must be a electronic billboard or we can call it flight information display system ( FIDS ), the function of the FID system is used to display  flight information to traveler, it live update the departure or arriving flight information, in case the travelers can arrived to the right gate by the time or any people wanted to pick up the traveler. 

Although the travelers or the passengers can refer to the FID system to get the flight information, but if any accidentally news or other new updated information and announcement, they are not able to know it in the time because the billboard is not developed at everywhere. In this situation, the public address system, as known as the PA system, will be important, it is an output device which enables announcers to display any voice track in the public area. Multiple microphones or other sound sources may be used in a PA system. Multiple amplifiers and loudspeakers may also be used for louder volume or broader distribution. 

Besides, other than the public output devices, there is an output device which is normally located at check-in counter, which is boarding pass printer, it is also an output device. A boarding pass printer enables the airline to print out boarding passes to the passenger, it gives the passenger permission to access the restricted area in an airport. Other than that, the boarding pass contained the date of flight, time of departure and arrival, and also flight number, all the important information is included inside.

### Security

The development of security is necessary, especially at airports, it is important to prevent sabotage, terrorism, actions that may be harmful to life and property or bombing. To protect the safety of passengers and airlines, there are few securities systems that should be installed in an airport. 

Firstly, X-ray machines are compulsory, to save more time, an x-ray system is suggested instead of opening the baggage, it can detect the item by using radiation, mostly used to detect if any harmful item is inside. The X-rays are detected by a monitor after they have passed through the object. The lower-energy X-rays are then blocked by a filter that receives the X-rays from this device. One more high-energy detector was struck by the leftover X-rays. To more accurately depict low-energy objects, such as the majority of organic materials, a computer circuit compares the pick-ups of the two detectors. 

After that, the following are metal detectors and body scanners, these two are similar, both are used to detect and check if any suspicious passenger carries any hidden object which does not want to be found, including weapon and illegal item.
