### Input technologies 

An input device is a hardware component that is used to enter data or commands into a computer or other electronic device. The input technologies that the organization will need in the airlines industry include kiosks check-in and handheld devices.

First, a kiosk check-in is a self-service process available at some airports that allows passengers to quickly and easily check themselves in using a touch-screen kiosk. Its features include self-service flight check-in, boarding pass printing, baggage inspection and baggage tag printing to assist with air travel. One of the benefits is a faster check-in process at the airport. Passengers can now check in faster through the kiosk, thus reducing queue times.

Second, handheld devices are designed to be portable and easy to use. It can also keep airline passengers constantly connected and informed. One of the latest advancements in input technologies is the integration of biometric sensors, such as facial recognition or fingerprints, into mobile devices used by gate agents. This enables them to log in to their devices quickly and efficiently on their way to the gate. Another benefit of this technology is that it can replace stand-alone scanning devices used for baggage and cargo checks, as well as provide access to airline lounges and scan boarding passes. This means that mobile devices can serve multiple functions and streamline the check-in process for both passengers and staff.

### Output technologies

The results or information generated by a system, method, or program are referred to as output. Output in computer programming can apply to any type of data that a program creates and writes to a file, another device, or the user's screen, including audio, text, images, and others. For summary, output is the finished product of a procedure or software that can be seen, examined, or otherwise used. 

After that, the output device, an output device is a hardware device used to display the result from a system or computer after being produced, in other words, output device is a device to display output data. Back to the major, the most important output device in the airline company must be a electronic billboard or we can call it flight information display system ( FIDS ), the function of the FID system is used to display  flight information to traveler, it live update the departure or arriving flight information, in case the travelers can arrived to the right gate by the time or any people wanted to pick up the traveler. 

Although the travelers or the passengers can refer to the FID system to get the flight information, but if any accidentally news or other new updated information and announcement, they are not able to know it in the time because the billboard is not developed at everywhere. In this situation, the public address system, as known as the PA system, will be important, it is an output device which enables announcers to display any voice track in the public area. Multiple microphones or other sound sources may be used in a PA system. Multiple amplifiers and loudspeakers may also be used for louder volume or broader distribution. 

Besides, other than the public output devices, there is an output device which is normally located at check-in counter, which is boarding pass printer, it is also an output device. A boarding pass printer enables the airline to print out boarding passes to the passenger, it gives the passenger permission to access the restricted area in an airport. Other than that, the boarding pass contained the date of flight, time of departure and arrival, and also flight number, all the important information is included inside.
