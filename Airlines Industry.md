### Input technologies 

An input device is a hardware component that is used to enter data or commands into a computer or other electronic device. The input technologies that the organization will need in the airlines industry include kiosks check-in and handheld devices.

First, a kiosk check-in is a self-service process available at some airports that allows passengers to quickly and easily check themselves in using a touch-screen kiosk. Its features include self-service flight check-in, boarding pass printing, baggage inspection and baggage tag printing to assist with air travel. One of the benefits is a faster check-in process at the airport. Passengers can now check in faster through the kiosk, thus reducing queue times.

Second, handheld devices are designed to be portable and easy to use. It can also keep airline passengers constantly connected and informed. One of the latest advancements in input technologies is the integration of biometric sensors, such as facial recognition or fingerprints, into mobile devices used by gate agents. This enables them to log in to their devices quickly and efficiently on their way to the gate. Another benefit of this technology is that it can replace stand-alone scanning devices used for baggage and cargo checks, as well as provide access to airline lounges and scan boarding passes. This means that mobile devices can serve multiple functions and streamline the check-in process for both passengers and staff.
